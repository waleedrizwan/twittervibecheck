## About
- This project was created so anyone can easily research real time Twitter discourse   
- Twitter is a valuable source of information regarding emotion and opinions.
- Given that Twitter has millions of users of all backgrounds, it is the perfect resource for real-time global sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis
- This project uses the **Sentiment Intensity Analyser** module from the **VADER Sentiment** Python library to analyze text. 
- **[VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner)](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)** is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

## Next Steps
- The Twitter API has major limits on the amount of requests and Tweets that can be pulled which prevents more in-depth analysis
- I am currently trying to eliminate the need for the official API by using the unofficial SNSCRAPE social media scraper which may open the door for unrestricted Tweet retrieval 
- How to simplify usage for new users
