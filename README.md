This project uses the vaderSentiment Python package to analyze text. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

This project was created to conduct sentiment analysis using tweets of individuals as well as tweets regarding a specific subject. I believe that Twitter is a valuable source of information regarding emotion, opinions and it gives us an up to date mental status of the world. Given that Twitter has millions of users of all backgrounds, it is the perfect resource for real-time global sentiment analysis.
